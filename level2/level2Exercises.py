#Ex. 1
    #write a function that tests whether a number is prime or not.
    #hint: use the modulo operator (%)
    #hint: n=1 and n=2 are separate cases. 1 is not prime and 2 is prime.

#Ex. 2
    #write a function that computes the Least Common Multiple of two numbers

#Ex. 3
    #write a program that prints this pattern, using a nested for loop:
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
*
    #extension: write a function that prints this pattern for any length
    #(the one above would be considered to have length 5)




#Ex. 4
	#fibonacci.py
	#write a function that prints out the first n
	#fibonacci numbers

	#1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...
	#f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

#Ex. 5
	#englishToPigLatin.py
	#function: a recipe that takes inputs and produces outputs
	#script: a sequence of instructions

	#write a function that takes an english word and translates it
	#into Pig Latin
	#pig latin: take the first letter of an english word, put it at the end,
	#and add "ay"
	#examples:
	#hello -> ellohay
	#why -> hyway
	#highway -> ighwayhay

	#next, write a function that takes a pig latin word,
	#and translates it into english.

	#after that, modify both functions so that they can take in a sentence
	#or paragraph, and translate either into pig latin or into english.

	mySentence = "today is a very nice good and also fun day"

#Ex. 6
	#sortList.py
	#sorts a list from smallest to largest

	theList = [-5,-23,5,-100,23,-6]
	#expected output: [-100,-23,-6,-5,5,23]

#Ex. 7
	#pascalTriangle.py
	#print the n-depth Pascal Triangle
	#An example of 5-depth output:
	[1]
	[2, 2]
	[3, 3, 3]
	[4, 4, 4, 4]
	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
