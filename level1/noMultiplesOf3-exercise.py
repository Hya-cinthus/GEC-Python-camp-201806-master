# noMultiplesOf3-exercise.py
# write a program that prints out all numbers
# from 0 to 100
# that are NOT multiples of 3.

# you can use for loop
# modulo operator: the remainder of a division
print(3%3) #gives us 0
print(4%3) #gives us 1
print(5%3) #gives us 2
print(6%3) #gives us 0 (6 is divisible by 3)
